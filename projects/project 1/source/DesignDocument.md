# Infix Calculator

As the name suggests, this application should function as a simple infix calculator. I wrote this application not only to fulfill the requirements for this course, but also to start learning C# and development for an Android OS. I consider it kind of a stretching of my mental arms and legs. A dipping my toes in the water.



## System Design 

This is where you specify all of the system's requirements.  This section should accurately portray the complete operation of your application.  Provide scenarios, use cases, system requirements, and diagrams/screenshots of the system.



## Usage

This is where you explain how to use your application
Clicking on the dark grey numberic buttons, including the button for a decimal point, should build numbers in the display to be used as operands in equations. The orange buttons on the right are used to designate which operator to use in your equation (multiplication, division, etc.), with the equals sign performing the operation. The light grey +/- button on the bottom left should shift a number from positive to negative, and vice versa.
