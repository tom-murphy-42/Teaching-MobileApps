# Post Mortem

I had a few obstacles that slowed down my progression in this assignment. A major one being that I was having issues with my emulator. Towards the end of the project my emulator (at home, but not at school) seemed to be handeling this project a lot better and I was also able to setup wireless debugging on my girlfriend's Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (her micro-usb port has some issues). To help mitigate this issue in the future, I have just purchased a Samsung Galaxy S7. It will be a few days before it arrives.

For this assignment, I felt as if 95% of my time was spent trying to get code functioning within the Android environment, and only 5% of my time was spent writing code in C#. I won't be surprised if this trend continues.

One struggle that I was able to overcome: While it is a rather small accomplishment, I got over the small hump of dealing with translating the Android graphic's colors into ints and back again. In fact, I'm pretty sure I can clean-up (simplify) that translation a fair bit more than what I currently have.

As for things that I have not yet completed: Well, I want to clean how I handle the bitmap/bitmap-copy data. I also wanted to implement preview thumbnails and sliders/percentages of most/each image effect (to be similar to most image filters on phones these days).

I am rather unhappy with the current state of my project. My girlfriend and I are both sick at the moment. It's unfortunate timing because we had already booked a cabin for Valentine's day. To be honest, I'd like to keep working on this project and submit a 2nd, more functional/complete version. One that can at least successfully call and execute two or more image manipulation functions. Due to my current schedule, it will probably be a few days before I can get back to working on it. I would then have to keep in mind all of the other things on my agenda, including the next project for this class...

The most enjoyable part of working on this assignment was getting the image manipulation functions to work (for the code in each function to do what it is intended to do, e.g. remove red or negate blue, etc..) The least enjoyable and also most challenging part of this project was trying to deal with the intracasies of coding for Androids. Various versions, permissions, etc. I suspect that while this will get easier with time/experience, it won't be a headache that will be easy to get rid of altogether.

For improving this project, and others, for future students I really like your idea of creating a wiki for  this class (in particular). I don't think we should wait until future semesters to implement that idea. I think we should start building that resource now.
